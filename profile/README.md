# Mycron and Mymux 
This organization contains information and programs about the computers from the Norwegian company [Mycron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycron) and the Mymux operating system that was written to run on the Mycron-1 computers from that company. 

The company still exists, but now under the name [MySoft](https://mysoft.no/).

## Mymux 
Mymux was a distributed multitasking operating system, using Hoare Monitors and "call packets" (remote procedure calls were not coined when this project started) to let user processes communicate with other user processes, kernel functionality and remote programs.

The documetation, sources and compiled programs provided here are from Professor Otto Anshus' Master's Thesis from 1981.
